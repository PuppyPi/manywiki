== Explooooooooringggggggg :>>> ==
. It has Wiki Templates, right!!?!
	YES
	PHEWWWWWWWWWwwwwwwwwwww XD



== JSPWiki normal! ==
•lp Configurable option: WikiCreole only, JSPWikiMarkup only!
•lp Configurably *lots* of punctuation allowed in page names (use rebound fsescape syntax if necessary, when using file-based, not SQL-based, storage)
•lp Detect text filetypes of attachments for indexing by content (ASCII or UTF-8) and metadata (text-or-not and encoding specified by user[s]), not by a hardcoded infinite list of simple filename suffixes x'D  (if it's not ASCII or UTF-8, we probably won't know how to decoded it for searching anyway!)
•lp Make as many as possible of the many configurable properties be through a pluggable API which can support an SQL basis (in another project)
•lp Configurable length of autogenerated password
•lp Separate out the code from the JSP to make it proper!
	• Then more refactoring for easyyyyyy Theeeeeeemeeeeeeeesssssss!! :DD
•lp Tab to see readonly wikimarkup page source
•lp Full automatic conversion between JSPWiki Markup and Creole so that ***the page data gets bijectively converted when you change the drop down menu!!!***  8)))
	• Also a separate library for that so people can make websites and command line tools and other apps just for converting! :D
	• Optional canonicalization of any markup upon page save/preview!  (letting preview function as a way of seeing, without saving, how their markup text is going to be modified ^^' )
•lp Semantic storage of which section an edit was on X3  (and if it renamed the section!)
•lp Allow deleting of pages!



== JSPWikifarm!! :D ==
• Split out as maaaaaaaany commonalities between JSPWiki and JSPWikifarm as poooooossibleeeeeeee!!
	• JSPWikifarm
	• JSPWikinotfarm
	• JSPJustWiki
	XD


• Many wikissssssss! :DD

• Highly Pure-Data-Configurable Userness!! :DD
	• Each wiki has a "users from" setting that says which wiki (possibly itself) users are from
	• Each wiki has a setting that says whether it's a "user wiki" where the "User:" prefix is dropped because it has no pages but user pages!!
	+ With these two things, all the needed configurations are possible!!  And can exist in the same JSPWikifarm Universe (Instance)!  :D
		• Just one normal wiki (a la Wikipedia)
		• Many wholly-independent normal wikis (a la Wikia)
		• Many wikis but sharing users! (a la ExoNet!)
			+ Note that the user wiki has the settings 'itself' and 'userwiki=true', so that does indeed happen!!  It wouldn't perhaps be terribly useful unless it's the userwiki for other wikis..but maybe someone just wants a wiki person-registry idk! XD :D
		• Complex combinations of the above! :D

• Use Templates from other wikis in the same universe! 8>
	+ If they allow that XD

• Private wikis and TONSSSSSsssssssss of privacy controls like Dreamwidth!! :'D


• interlinks
	"::" for intra-farm interwiki links
	":::" for inter-farm interwiki links
		and each wiki can make up its own and optionally inherit others'!  :>
	:D

• directory-path-like namespacing of wikis in the farm!
	so you can have "worlds" within your "wikigalaxy"

• "Under Maintenance" pages, not just sitewide, but per-wiki in case the *data* needs to be maintained!  (eg, migrated to another server X3 or restored after a password compromise or something else not involving a flaw in the code!)



== Lower-priority ==
!!• SNI multiplexing directly in eCoops' Tomcat??
!!• eCoops restart without restarting Tomcat? :D
